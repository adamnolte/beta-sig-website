export const WhoWeAre = 'The Iota Chapter of Beta Sigma Psi is a diverse group of men that is always looking to exceed expectations and grow more influence on the University of Missouri campus. We take pride in having a wide range of men in this fraternity, and our overall goal is to spread the values bestowed in us by former members and in our national and chapter constitutions. We are open to any and all men on the University of Missouri that are willing to uphold and add to our values as a fraternity. We hope to continue to grow in size and in our influence across campus. We encourage our Associate Members to become members of other organizations that could extend our reach and help spread our values. We are wholly committed to the scholastic implications that come with being a full time University student, and it is our goal as a fraternity to help our associate and active members succeed in their given academic fields. We also are happy to take part in all social aspects of college life and campus life, including independent socials, and participating in the University of Missouri Homecoming and Greek Week. Lastly, our fraternity has an ongoing commitment with servicing the University and the Columbia community at large through philanthropic acts and events. We strongly encourage our members to only champion these values, but be living examples of our ideals';
